# Sales Data Processor API

A FastAPI application for processing large CSV files containing departmental sales data.

## Features

- Process large CSV files efficiently using streaming/chunked reading
- Aggregate sales data by department
- Background processing for large files
- Downloadable results
- Metrics collection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Application

- uvicorn app.main:app --reload


The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/sales/process` - Upload a CSV file for processing
  - Parameters:
    - `file`: The CSV file to upload
    - `async_processing`: Set to true for background processing
- `GET /api/v1/sales/download/{file_id}` - Download a processed file


## Using Docker
1. Clone the repository
2. docker compose up --build app app
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`


## Testing

Run tests with:

pytest



## Algorithm Explanation

The solution processes CSV files in chunks to handle large files efficiently:

1. **Streaming Processing**: The CSV file is read line by line, never loading the entire file into memory.
2. **Incremental Aggregation**: Sales numbers are aggregated by department as each row is processed.
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Only the aggregated totals (department name â†’ total sales) are kept in memory, not the original data.
4. **Background Processing**: Large files can be processed asynchronously to avoid blocking the API.

### Computational Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of rows in the CSV
- Space Complexity: O(m) where m is the number of unique departments (typically much smaller than n)
